# Martin's Obsidian Vault Helpers

This is a collection of helper functions to manage my Obsidian Vault:

- Find orphaned attachments that are not used in any of the documents and move them to the inbox.
- Find pages which are not registered in a structure not and move them to the inbox.

This assumes that the Vault has the top level directories `Attachments`, `Inbox`, `Pages` and `Structure Notes`.

This project uses Python 3.9 or later, and it doesn't have any external dependencies.
